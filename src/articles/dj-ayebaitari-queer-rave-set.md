### Cosmic rave sounds for the Asymetrics by the one and only [Ayebaitari](https://www.instagram.com/ayebaitari__/?hl=en) !

A visual and performance artist, **Ayebaitari** recently took up the decks and launched **[Queer Rave](https://www.facebook.com/Queer.Rave/)**: a community project that celebrates and represents queer, female and genderqueer Drum & Bass DJs, with [support from AZ Mag](https://djmag.com/news/xilhu-ayebaitari-ese-awarded-az-mag-creative-grant-collaboration-dj-mag) and DJ Mag among many.

Strongly influenced by the likes of **Kemistry & Storm**, Goldie, or even **Talvin Singh**, she blurs the lines between old-school Jungle and contemporary sounds like Grime or Gqom, and is also often at the control of her psychedelic visuals while djing:

Ayebaitari is also often found behind the camera, with a cool fetish for old school camcorders and analog video synths, producing [experimental videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHHmAgGzzuo) and clips such as this badass one for Dj Giulia Tess and Nan Kolè's fire tune with NyNy:

Having recently caught the attention of [RAM Records](https://ramrecords.com/news/14885/the-interview-ayebaitari), and with the Queer Rave events finally materializing in London town after a year long Covid-hiatus, you can be sure to hear much more from this firestarter soon !
