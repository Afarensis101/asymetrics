### Gazonade

<br>

Record collector and producer, **Gazon** is exploring music in all its forms.

Heavily influenced by blues and gospel music in his early years, he later got impressed by the federating power of electronic music.

His mixes are landscapes, travelling through space and ages. Ancestral rhythms fused with modern grooves, taking you off for a visionary odyssey.

In a constant struggle to explore new ways of expressions, he recently started [producing music](https://gazonade.bandcamp.com). Offering deep soulful grooves from disco to techno.
