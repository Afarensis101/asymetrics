### We've been following Francesco Cucchi's self reinvention into [Blu Ritual](https://bluritual.bandcamp.com/releases) after years of running the groundbreaking Gqom Oh! label (read all about it in our **[previous interview](https://theasymetrics.com/blog/blu-ritual/)**), and are now thrilled to share this new dancefloor bomb !

Out on Friday, July 30th 2021...

Preorder here: <https://bluritual.bandcamp.com/album/since-94-86-ly>

A large catalyst for Blu Ritual’s change in musical direction was ditching the classic laptop + DAW setup and swapping it for a ‘live jam’ workflow centred around the powerful [Teenage Engineering OP-1](https://teenage.engineering/products/op-1).

**Since '94 / 8.6 LY** is a  prelude to a larger body of work, a taster of the sort of trippy but nonetheless dancefloor-ready cuts you’ll be hearing from Blu Ritual !

### Buy "Since '94" / "8.6 LY" on [](https://bluritual.bandcamp.com/releases)[Bandcamp](https://bluritual.bandcamp.com/album/since-94-86-ly) (available 30 July)
