Direct Link to full Mixtape:**[Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/the-asymetrics/malongs-round-up-8?in=the-asymetrics/sets/malongs-monthly-round-up)**

### Special edition !

### On a very short trip to Paris, I took the opportunity to catch up with the Asymetrics' own [Lord Sandwich](https://soundcloud.com/the-asymetrics/sets/sandwich-selections), who was stashing piles of records for me, and recorded this 8th round on a whim (with a bit of his help on the dub sirens).

#### I picked a bunch of killer represses, and a few more recent (or not) cuts, here goes:

<br>

**Cornell Campbell – Jah Jah Mi Horn Yah (Dubplate Mix)**

<iframe width="100%" height="380" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AQJHWAGgyEc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen referrerpolicy="origin"></iframe>

<br>

<br>

I couldn't find any full version of this "dubplate" cut on the interwebz, so this is the original 1973 tune. It's one of my all time favorite reggae tracks and I literally jumped off my chair when I heard this version with a twist, hot off the press courtesy of the good folks at [Common Grounds International](https://commongroundinternational.bandcamp.com/music).

You'll just have to listen to the [mixtape](https://soundcloud.com/the-asymetrics/malongs-round-up-8?in=the-asymetrics/sets/malongs-monthly-round-up) to hear it !

<br>

<br>

**Orquesta Pacho Galán – Estambul**

<iframe width="100%" height="380" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/laO131ml6G0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen referrerpolicy="origin"></iframe>

<br>

<br>

Wicked Latin Swing cover of the [1953 hit by the Four Lads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul_(Not_Constantinople)), Estambul was recently unearthed by a Belgian label I'm particularly fond of: [Radio Martiko](https://radiomartiko.bandcamp.com/) - don't miss their catalog of reissues, these guys have a serious knack for beautiful and unique sounds !

<br>

<br>

**Lito Barrientos y su orchestra - Cumbia en Do Meno**

<iframe width="100%" height="380" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QcyKExm6je8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen referrerpolicy="origin"></iframe>

<br>

<br>

All time classic ! This 1966 cumbia bomb from Salvadorian musician [Lito Barrientos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Barrientos) had been on my wishlist for years... Ever cool Spanish imprint [Vampisoul ](https://vampisoul.bandcamp.com/music)made it happen with a 45 repress.

<br>

<br>

**Orquesta Akokán – un Tabaco para Elegua**

<iframe width="100%" height="380" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Rt--PFwe2Ww" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen referrerpolicy="origin"></iframe>

<br>

<br>

A bit of deep contemporary Cuban grooves to take it easy ! [](https://www.orquestaakokan.com/home)

[Orquesta Akokan](https://www.orquestaakokan.com/home) is a cross-generational band gathering talents from all over the island, who caught the attention of mighty US label [Daptone](https://daptonerecords.com/). The band's [self titled debut album](https://daptonerecords.com/artists/orquesta-akokan/), released in 2019, was the first Spanish language release by the label, and was recorded in Havana's legendary Areito studios, no less !

<br>

<br>

**Jimmy Salcedo y Su Onda Tres – Moogambo**

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1928691108/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=4137564801/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://vampisoul.bandcamp.com/album/maraguango-moogambo">Maraguango / Moogambo by Jimmy Salcedo</a></iframe>

![](/img/theasymetrics_jimmy_salcedo.jpg)

<br>

<br>

Another great repress by [Vampisoul ](https://vampisoul.bandcamp.com/music), this tripped-out 45 highlights the great talent of Colombian showman [Jimmy Salcedo](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Salcedo), who ran a TV show in the 1970's and 80s blending interviews and comedy sketches - check it !

<br>

<br>

**Coisa Nossa – Procurando O Caminho**

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3926174004/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=3860710484/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://vampisoul.bandcamp.com/album/procurando-o-caminho">Procurando O Caminho by Coisa Nossa</a></iframe>

![](/img/theasymetrics_coisa_nossa.jpg)

<br>

<br>

Also just repressed by Vampisoul (you guessed it, I quite like their releases), this rare funky Bossa cut features Salomé de Bahia, who went on to gain massive success in the early 2000s with her international House anthem [Outro Lugar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5wODg8qcIU).

<br>

<br>

**The Chosen Few – Collie Dub**

<iframe width="100%" height="380" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4UaIsbsxnpE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen referrerpolicy="origin"></iframe>

<br>

<br>

1975 mad funky Reggae, [Collie Stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYYov6Rd89o) by the Chosen Few got a timely re-issue by Japanese crew [Rock a Shaka](https://www.discogs.com/label/220564-Rock-A-Shacka) - I found the Dub jubilatory and couldn't help throwing it out here !

<br>

**Joe Gibbs and the Professionals – Six Foot Six (Prince Alla Dub)**

<iframe width="100%" height="380" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kVJWlHeLrPM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen referrerpolicy="origin"></iframe>

<br>

<br>

Killer dub found on the flip of a [Prince Alla repress](https://www.discogs.com/Prince-Alla-Joe-Gibbs-The-Professionals-Naw-Go-A-Them-Burial-Six-Foot-Six/release/15190436) !

<br>

<br>

**Junior Murvin – Give me Your Love**

<iframe width="100%" height="380" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ar-bJyNBoFg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen referrerpolicy="origin"></iframe>

<br>

<br>

The sweet sweet voice of [Junior Murvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_Murvin), extracted from a [recent compilation](https://www.discogs.com/Clive-Azul-Hunt-Bad-Bad-Bad-Golden-Age-Reggae-From-A-Legendary-Producer/release/17191471), tribute to one of Jamaica's most creative and versatile producer: [Clive Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Hunt).

<br>

<br>

**Sippy – Creation**

<iframe width="100%" height="380" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4F4XSg1l5vw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen referrerpolicy="origin"></iframe>

<br>

<br>

Gorgeous, deep Trinidad Soca rocker ! I owe this great addition to my collection to [Matteo Fava](https://www.facebook.com/matteo.fava.79), who put it on my radar in his [excellent Asymetrics Mixtape](https://theasymetrics.com/blog/asymetrics-mixtape-14-matteo-fava/).

A tropical dj favorite, original copies of this 12" used to be a highly prized item, but it was just repressed by (again) [Common Grounds International](https://commongroundinternational.bandcamp.com/music) and will be available again next month after 4 decades in obscurity !

<br>

<br>

**Tohon Stan - Gotta**

<iframe width="100%" height="380" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R5VV9_KklRc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen referrerpolicy="origin"></iframe>

<br>

<br>

I got tipped on this one by Paris' heavyweight digger [Armand de Preseau](http://africangrooves.fr/), who runs the [Nubiphone](https://nubiphone.bandcamp.com/) and [Nanga Boko](https://www.facebook.com/nangabokorecords/) reissue labels: fire funk from Benin !

<br>

<br>

**François Nkotti – Loko La Mboa**

<iframe width="100%" height="380" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ceti_A2epJ4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen referrerpolicy="origin"></iframe>

<br>

<br>

...and speaking of [Nanga Boko](http://africangrooves.fr/category/label/) and Armand de Preseau, this mad Cameroonian psych tune is part of a great LP reissued a couple years ago - don't miss !

We just interviewed **de Preseau,** who not only runs two great imprints, but also has a mad flair for great grooves from all around the World. Expect more stories on the Asymetrics very soon...

<br>

<br>

**Alonso Wilson de Briano – Amigo**

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PBZMzTNM5Mc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen referrerpolicy="origin"></iframe>

<br>

<br>

Opening title of my favorite reissue this year, **Amigo** highlights the incredible versatily in Panamanian beats of Alonso Wilson de Briano's 1961 "Winsor Style & Calypso Impression".

If you haven't read it yet, don't miss our **[interview with the Mokomizik team](https://theasymetrics.com/blog/label-story-2-mokomizik/)**, passionate people behind this incredible repress !

<br>

**Taiwan MC Feat Anouk Aïata – One Last Dance**

<br>

<br>

One our friend Sticky Tai Tai's most praised tunes, produced by none other than [Samity ](https://theasymetrics.com/blog/story-of-a-track-katibim/)!

This one [came out on 45](https://www.discogs.com/Taiwan-MC-Anouk-A%C3%AFata-Samity-One-Last-Dance/release/14463913) last year, and can also be found on Taiwan's latest album ["Special Request"](https://theasymetrics.com/blog/special-request/) - grab it !
