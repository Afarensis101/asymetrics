#### Buy the EP: <https://disc.fanlink.to/WhatTheFrenchEP>

### The idea behind “What The French” is simple: unify the French Bass music scene  and assert its identity.

15 years into their career, the [Dirtyphonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirtyphonics) felt a desire to mentor the new generation of French producers and share their experience through a specially crafted project.

 Every track in ["What the French"](https://disc.fanlink.to/WhatTheFrenchEP) is a reference to symbolic places within Paris which hold a special place in the Dirtyphonics' heart, and has been produced alongside talents of the hexagonal new school. Take a trip:

### **[Bastille (Dirtyphonics & Ivory)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqh79xMInwg)**
