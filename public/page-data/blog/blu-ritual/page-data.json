He was about to launch the first release of<a href=\"https://gqomoh.bandcamp.com/music\"> <strong>Gqom-Oh</strong></a><strong>!</strong> and I had no idea what was about to hit me! Casually mentioning the project, his usual humble stance did not prepare me.</p>\n<p>As he passed me his headphones to check the first tracks that were about to be released, I got slapped on the brain!</p>\n<p>I remember telling him how staggering the music was, and how I thought something so fresh, at the time only known to a handful of kids in the townships of <strong>Durban</strong>, had the potential to run a tsunami over London and Berlin!</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/theasymetrics_gqom-oh-1.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Fast forward to 2020</strong>, and the outsider South African beat is everywhere.

How do I address you now?</strong></em></p>\n<p>Nan Kolè, as all things in life, came to an end. It was a beautiful journey but a lot of things changed and I want to be more \"honest\" and authentic to my higher self in my new endeavors. I have reconnected to some of the musical experiences from my twenties when I was raving and travelling in a van with my sound system.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/theasymetrics_cukiman_90s.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em><strong>Francesco &#x26; one of his techno collective van, Late 90s/Early 2000s</strong></em></p>\n <br>\n<p>I’ve also looked into new ways of creating music and created the<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/blu-ritual\"> <strong>Blu Ritual</strong></a> project:</p>\n<p>The name represents my new approach on composing tracks: Having plenty of time during the recent lockdown, I learned new methods and created a sort of personal ritual, taking my time, meditating, cleansing energies in my room and sometimes <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/what-is-microdosing\">micro-dosing</a> mushrooms, which allow a sort of “elapsed” perception of time. I’m also working with intuition. Essentially trying to rush nothing but committed to a start and conclusion of the ritual.</p>\n<p>Blue is the main color I envision in the process, and the melodies that come to me are often melancholic and deep.</p>\n<h4>Blu Ritual</h4>\n<p><img src=\"/img/theasymetrics_bluritual_scattereddemo.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1833239264/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/artwork=none/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"https://bluritual.bandcamp.com/album/scattered-demo\">Scattered demo by Blu Ritual</a></iframe>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>Under Blu Ritual, I just released a first EP via Bandcamp (<em><strong>Scattered Demo</strong></em>, above) and 2 more EPs: <em><strong>Numbers &#x26; Colours</strong></em> and <em><strong>Epichysis</strong></em> (recorded in one sole psychedelic session) will come out in December. They will be released on digital and double-cassette tapes on Italian label<a href=\"https://mfzrecords.bandcamp.com/\"> <strong>MFZ records</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>I am also working with a very talented new visual artist called<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ayebaitari__/\"> <strong>Ayebaitari</strong></a> on the graphics and videos of he project.</p>\n<p><em><strong>- Can you describe where you're headed with this new project?

I don’t feel that an artist necessarily needs external synths, drums or hardware, that's just my personal feeling and journey right now, it doesn't makes my music \"better” though.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/theasymetrics_bluritual2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<br>\n<p>In addition, I actually feel great having reset, and starting from scratch on the scene and social media, even though it can be challenging (who likes having 10 plays on Soundcloud and 5 followers on Instagram – LOL). I'm enjoying the new freedom, and feel more compelled to discover and follow new artists without the aim to network or do marketing of my stuff. Even my timelines on social networks are different these days, and I enjoy spending time on it much more!</p>\n<p><em><strong>- So while you will be stepping back from the Nan Kolè project, you remain active with the Gqom Oh!

I’m very critical of Italy in general, and of the music scene in particular. I feel that there is also a “white-washing” of black music (Jazz in the past, now Hip-Hop, Trap and even more underground electronics etc.), without enough connection or support to their real roots, not even to Italian POC, from those communities where these musics come from. We definitely have an issue of mimicking and appropriating Black cultures in Italy.</p>\n<p>At the same time, now being an immigrant in the UK, I have noticed how real the uprooted feeling is. I’m living with two other Italian artists here in London, and thanks to this vibe in the house I have been trying to reconnect with Italian “<strong>Cantauroriale</strong>” music or lost traditional and folk songs of the Italian South, such as <strong><a href=\"https://www.romecentral.com/en/gli-stornelli-romani-e-le-classiche-canzoni-romane/\">Stornelli Romani</a></strong> or <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzica\">Pizzica</a></strong> and <strong>Salterello</strong>, which are actually really powerful and sometimes rooted in rituals and forms of shamanism like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_eye\">“<strong>Malocchio</strong>”</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarantism\">\"<strong>Tarantismo</strong>\"</a></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"200\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/675501206&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\"></iframe><div style=\"font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;\"><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/agostino2801\" title=\"AGOSTINO\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\">AGOSTINO</a> · <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/agostino2801/officina-zoe-suttacqua-e-sutta-jentu-remix\" title=\"Officina Zoè - Sutt&#x27;acqua E Sutta Jentu (EDIT)\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\">Officina Zoè - Sutt&#x27;acqua E Sutta Jentu (EDIT)</a></div>\n<p>I have great hopes for people like <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/agostino2801/\">Agostino</a>, with his <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/turbosud/\">Turbo Sud</a> project and<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/giuliatess\"> Dj Tess</a> with her new alias<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mala_femmina_/\"> Mala Femmina</a>, I can see that they are fuelling a new authentic, genuine Italian music scene from the south, it's going to be interesting to experience it and see it grow.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"200\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/910496935&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\"></iframe><div style=\"font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;\"><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/malafemmina\" title=\"Mala Femmina\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\">Mala Femmina</a> · <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/malafemmina/ruff\" title=\"Ruff\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\">Ruff</a></div>\n<br>\n<p><em><strong>- You've been playing quite literally around the World in the past few years - any travel stories or discoveries you care to share?</strong></em></p>\n<p>Traveling has given me so much on many different levels, especially thanks to the fact that I was traveling to do what I love. It was great to see the youth of each and every corner doing their own music and building scenes.
