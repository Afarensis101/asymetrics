He started it!“ „No, that’s not true! Liar!“ „You’re a liar, „You’re lying! Not me!“</p>\n<p>And so it went on and on. And it got worse and worse.<br>\nAnd even the parents didn’t know who to trust anymore, or who to reprimand.<br>\nIt was a messy situation.</p>\n<p>Then the little sister of the two came and pushed her way through the crowd that had formed around the quarrelers.<br>\nWith her little arms she embraced her brothers,<br>\nwithout words, only with love, with peace.<br>\nAnd the two stopped,<br>\nbecause they were not incited, as they were used to be,<br>\nor insulted by third parties, as they were used to,<br>\nbecause no one had taken the side of one or the other…<br>\nand no one could feel better or worse than the other.</p>\n<p>Three people, three siblings,<br>\njust like that,<br>\nin love, in peace…</p>\n<p>May we not talk so much about the others, but talk a lot with the others...</p>\n<p>So that we find out that in many things, the others are not so much different than we are.<br>\nMay we reduce the separating and increase the connecting.<br>\nMay we not consider the differences so important, but enjoy the common name instead.<br>\nMay peace, love, freedom and brotherhood be in us and for all.<br>\nMay it become where<br>\nMay it be so</p>\n<p>Ahoooo</p>\n<h3>Find Out more about Andi on <a href=\"https://andirietschel.wordpress.com/\">His Website</a> / <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/andi-rietschel\">Soundcloud</a></h3>","frontmatter":{"author":"Asymetrics","categories":"mixtapes","tags":["#World","#Tribal","#Reggae","#Dub","#Jungle","#Drum&Bass","#Trance","#House","#asymetricstapes"],"teaser":"Andi, from the Leipzig Tribe of Peace presents: \"Reconnecting\" an exclusive mix for The Asymetrics !","title":"Asymetrics Mixtape #26: Andi Rietschel - Reconnecting...","date":"August 04, 2021"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/7-bad-mixtapes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"7 Bad Mixtapes "}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/7-bad-mixtapes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"7 Bad Mixtapes "}}},"pageContext":{"id":"26d9a325-baea-5bf4-8387-c5428eade899","next":{"id":"840ca9fb-af76-5270-9d46-1a8b50966904","fields":{"slug":"/asymetrics-mixtape-24-m-boo/"},"frontmatter":{"categories":"mixtapes","tags":["#Soul","#Roots","#Bass","#Rave","#Jungle","#Drum&Bass","#Vinyl","#asymetricstapes"],"templateKey":"blog-post"}},"postPath":"/blog/asymetrics-mixtape-26-andi-rietschel-reconnecting/","previous":{"id":"2625e82f-b828-5e79-b320-c7c905ac8cdf","fields":{"slug":"/asymetrics-mixtape-27-chérie-kicks-le-bon-summer-mix/"},"frontmatter":{"categories":"mixtapes","tags":["#House","#bass","#Breaks"],"templateKey":"blog-post"}},"slug":"/asymetrics-mixtape-26-andi-rietschel-reconnecting/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
