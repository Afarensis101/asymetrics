But the tune as it is known today and which inspired hundreds of covers the World around is a classic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_folk_music#T%C3%BCrk%C3%BC\">Turkü</a>, also known as Üsküdar'a Gider İken:</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ag0D16-y0to\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen referrerpolicy=\"origin\"></iframe>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>So popular is the song in Turkey, it inspired a classic movie released back in 1956, and remade into a major commercial success in 1968: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9rVqvAsBas\">Katip</a>, which featured popular musician and actor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeki_M%C3%BCren\">Zeki Müren</a>, and dramatizes the story of the legendary clerk (Katip / Katibim for \"my clerk\") from Uskudar, so praised by women who would set eyes upon him.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/theasymetrics_katibim_movie.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Samity</strong> was born in<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardzhali\"> Kardzhali</a>, in the Eastern part of the Rhodope mountains in Bulgaria, an area largely populated by ethnic Turks. His grandmother used to sing many Turkish folk songs and <em>Katibim</em> was one of them. <em><strong>\"I was really into the song as a kid\"</strong></em> he says, <em><strong>\"and it's funny because when I first heard Ken Boothe's version years later as a reggae musician, I instantly loved it but did not make the connection! It took me a few years and I wondered how this old song from way back in the Ottoman Empire had reached Jamaica\".</strong></em></p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/theasymetrics_katibim_postcard.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<br>\n<p>So Samity did a bit of research and found out this incredible piece of music history:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munir_Ertegun\">Munir Ertegun</a>, one of the most prominent diplomats from the young Turkish Republic, proclaimed in 1923, was appointed Ambassador to the USA in 1934. He brought his pianist wife with him, and young son<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmet_Ertegun\"> Ahmet Ertegun</a> who became a serious jazz enthusiast and eventually founded cornerstone label<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Records\"> Atlantic Records</a> in 1947 !</p>\n<p>Among Ertugun’s many friends was legendary <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eartha_Kitt\">Eartha Kitt</a> who, fresh back from a tour in Turkey (which may have been an early Cold War soft power effort from the US to seduce Turkey out of Soviet’s influence) and with a bit of Ertegun’s help on the lyrics, went on to record a tune called <strong>\"Uska Dara\"</strong> in <strong>1953</strong>, sung in Turkish, which is a cover of, you guessed it, none other than Katibim...</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/knRnnTpxI-w\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen referrerpolicy=\"origin\"></iframe>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>The song was a major hit and was performed by Eartha for decades over her career.</p>\n<p>Just a few years later was Jamaica's independence (1962), and the island's radios were flooded with US hits, quite possibly bringing Eartha's wonderful take to Coxsone, then Boothe's ears !</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/theasymetrics_eartha_istanbul_1961.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em><strong>Eartha in Istanbul (1951)</strong></em></p>\n<br>\n<p>As for Samity, the project had been on his mind for many years: <em><strong>\"After my first gig in Istanbul years ago, I thought I needed something special for the Turkish massive. At first I thought I would try a Reggae cover of superstar <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar%C4%B1%C5%9F_Man%C3%A7o\">Baris Manco</a>, but finally remembered Katibim”</strong></em>;</p>\n<p><em><strong>\"I did a first take 4 or 5 years ago that I voiced myself and which I shelved... Then came Covid last year, and I really wanted to do something meaningful for my crew in Turkey who were struggling, so I dug out the track from an old hard-drive, redid the instrumental completely and thought about <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/orcunleosunear/?hl=en\">Orçun Sünear</a>, who is the lead singer in  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sattasband\"> Sattas</a>, one of the biggest reggae bands in the country...\"</strong></em></p>\n<br>\n<p><img src=\"/img/theasymetrics_samity_orc%CC%A7un_sunear.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Orçun</strong> is a musician and political activist, and a bit of a legend in Turkey !. After years of dabbling in plenty music genres (including Death Metal back in the 1990’s), he founded <strong>Sattas</strong> in 2004, the most prominent Reggae band in Turkey, and regularly appears on national TV show <strong>“Benimle Söyle”</strong> (somewhat of an equivalent to “the Voice”). The perfect voice to bring Katibim back….</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/theasymetrics_orc%CC%A7un-su%CC%88near_luciano.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<br>\n<p><em><strong>\"I wasn't sure what to do with the track, as it was pretty far from the vibe I usually release on my label<a href=\"https://riceandpeasrecords.bandcamp.com/\"> Rice &#x26; Peas records</a>”</strong></em>, says Samity, <em><strong>“so I played it to<a href=\"http://www.obfdub.net/\"> OBF's</a> Rico, who is also a big fan of Anatolian Folk, Rock and Psych and he instantly suggested to release it on<a href=\"https://obf-dubquake-records.bandcamp.com/\"> Dubquake</a>!\"</strong></em></p>\n<h4>Tale of a Reggae anthem in the making….</h4>\n<br>\n<p>….And yet, this is not the end of our incredible story...</p>\n<p>As it turns out, Katibim's beautiful melody has influenced musicians all over the World for well over a century, and can be heard in the repertoire of early American<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klezmer\"> Klezmer</a> spearhead<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naftule_Brandwein\"> Naftule Brandwein</a> in this 1924 recording:</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MzDG_ls9FFg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;
