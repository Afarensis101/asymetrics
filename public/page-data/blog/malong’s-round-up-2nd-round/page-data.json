My all-time favorite genre gets a gorgeous revival with new Accra-based outlet Santrofi and it’s mind-boggling!</p>\n<p>While Highlife got a massive revival among World music lovers since record label <a href=\"https://soundwayrecords.bandcamp.com/music\">Soundway</a> dropped the seminal 2002 <a href=\"https://soundwayrecords.bandcamp.com/album/ghana-soundz-afro-beat-funk-fusion-in-70s-ghana\">Ghana Soundz</a>, followed up by many other fantastic compilations (too many to list here but check Soundway’s back catalogue, or <a href=\"https://www.analogafrica.com/\">Analog Africa’s</a> Afrobeat Airways installments for a start), it has cruelly lacked genuine productions in Ghana itself in the past few decades; and while <a href=\"https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/3673\">Ghana is a major incubator</a> for incredible new music trends (plenty topics for future Asymetrics articles), <a href=\"https://outhererecords.bandcamp.com/album/santrofi-alewa\">Santrofi’s Alewa</a> album comes as a breath of fresh air, somewhat outside of Accra’s current dance drivers, yet not completely retro.
